# RandomForestMachineLearning
This is the sample code for the machine learning model building using the random forest classifier to predict the salaries.

The code is made available on the google colab environment.

The code covers the following concepts:

1. Data Loading
    a) Loading from the colab runtime - 
2. Data cleaning and prepping
    b) Categorizing the numerical and categorical variables.
    c) Computing the percentage of imputations required. Should be in the preferrable range of 2 to 10 % of data.
    c) One hot encoder for converting categorical to numerical.
    d) Scaling the data using min-max approach
    e) Splitting the data in test/train modules
    f) Doing missing value imputations using KNN.
3. Preparing the model
    g) Grid search to find the best parameters.
    h) Random Forest classifier to predict accuracy.
4.  Visualizing the data and gathering inputs.
